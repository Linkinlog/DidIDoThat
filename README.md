# TODOs
- [ ] Add a description of the project
- [ ] Clicking more qr codes makes more, it should only make one
- [ ] Alert user that new qr codes destroy old ones
- [ ] Alert user that we even use qr codes for auth, probably early on
- [ ] We are using http cookies
- [ ] Add a favicon
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] we probably want a backup to the qr codes cause it might be pretty annoying
